This website was built off of a website framework which I acquired from a programming bootcamp I took in the 2017, Dev Bootcamp. It utilizes the smash.gg API to automate the creation of database objects and then uses Javascript to make local database calls and display data. It is hosted at [https://tripoint-stats.herokuapp.com/](https://tripoint-stats.herokuapp.com/).
